# ATAM_TESTS
Hi!
be sure to have the exact same directory hirarchy as SEGEL wants.
1)	copy all files from this repository into the main directory,which should have part1, part2 and this repository, also download prog from dry homework
2) 	run the script, if you don't get a message, that means all tests have passed, if you do get a message, better luck next time!.

P.S if run.sh and tester_2.sh don't work, first do chmod +x run.sh then have at it.

P.S.2 a_2.o file is too big to upload on github, i'll send it on whatsapp.
enjoy :)
