# ATAM_TESTS
Hi!
be sure to have the exact same directory hirarchy as SEGEL wants.
1)	copy all files from this repository into the main directory, including tests directory.tests contains expected, output and run.sh (test script runner).
2) 	be sure to also have part2 directory in the main directory too, i used the segel's other files as tests too (a.o b.o and prof from dry hw, i used it only to test section         table).
3) 	run the script, if you don't get a message, that means all tests have passed, if you do get a message, better luck next time!.

P.S if run.sh doesn't work, first do chmod +x run.sh then have at it.

enjoy :)
