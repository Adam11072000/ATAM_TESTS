# ATAM_TESTS
Hi!
be sure to have the exact same directory hirarchy as SEGEL wants.
1)	make a directory names tests in the main directory.
2) 	copy all the files into it. (be sure to also have part2 directory, i used the segel's 		other files as tests too, also copy prog from dry hw to the main directory).
3) 	run the script, if you don't get a message, that means all tests have passed, if you do get a message, better luck next time!.

P.S if run.sh doesn't work, first do chmod +x run.sh then have at it.

enjoy :)
